### Task 3 – Fix Importance Mapping (Section 1)

- Issue:The Importance value was not preserved when converting a TodoItem to TodoItemEditFields, causing the test EqualImportance to fail.

- Diagnosis:The test setup correctly passed Importance.High using a test builder. However, in the TodoItemEditFields constructor, the line Importance = Importance.Medium ignored the incoming parameter and always defaulted the value.

- Solution:Replaced the hardcoded line with:

    - Importance = importance;

- This allows the constructor to honor the input value passed from the mapping factory.

- Result:All tests in WhenTodoItemIsConvertedToEditFields now pass, confirming the mapping is correct.

### (Section 2: UI Enhancements and Feature Fixes)

### Task 4: Update Views/TodoList/Detail.cshtml to display items sorted by importance
## Approach and Logic

-   Although the instruction refers to modifying the Razor view directly, a cleaner and more maintainable approach was to move the sorting logic into the ViewModel factory (TodoListDetailViewmodelFactory). This aligns with the Single Responsibility Principle by keeping the Razor view focused on rendering, while the factory handles data shaping.

-   The following change was made in TodoListDetailViewmodelFactory.Create(...):
    var items = todoList.Items
        .OrderByDescending(x => x.Importance)
        .Select(TodoItemSummaryViewmodelFactory.Create)
        .ToList();

- This ensures that items are sorted in the correct order (High > Medium > Low) before they reach the view, resulting in cleaner Razor code and better separation of concerns.

### Task 5 - Replace "ResponsiblePartyId" with friendly display text

- Files Updated:
Views/TodoItem/Create.cshtml
Views/TodoItem/Edit.cshtml

# Issue:

- The label for assigning a responsible user was displayed as the raw property name "ResponsiblePartyId", which may be unclear or confusing for users.

# Solution:

- Replaced the default Razor label binding with a more user-friendly label:
    <label asp-for="ResponsiblePartyId">Assigned To</label>

This change keeps the asp-for directive to preserve form validation and model binding, while improving the label text for clarity.

# Logic:

- Enhancing field labels with user-friendly text improves the overall user experience, especially for non-technical users. The change maintains full functionality while aligning the terminology with user expectations.

### Task 6 – Add ability to toggle visibility of completed items

# Files Updated:
TodoListController.cs
Views/TodoList/Detail.cshtml

# Issue:

- The UI displayed both completed and pending items without giving the user control to filter out completed tasks.

# Solution:

- Added a hideCompleted query parameter to the Detail action in TodoListController. If hideCompleted is true, the controller filters out completed items before passing them to the ViewModel factory.

- In the view (Detail.cshtml), added a toggle button that updates the URL with hideCompleted=true or false, allowing users to switch between viewing all items and hiding completed ones.

# Logic:

This approach keeps the filtering logic in the controller, avoids overloading the view, and maintains a stateless, link-driven UI using query parameters. The solution improves usability without complicating the user experience or data model.

### Task 6 – Show Relevant Todo Lists

# Approach:
- To meet the requirement of showing all Todo lists where the current user is either the owner or assigned as the responsible party for at least one item:

- A new method RelevantTodoLists(userId) was added to ApplicationDbContext.
- It filters the lists using an Include(...).ThenInclude(...) chain to ensure items and their related ResponsibleParty are loaded.
- The query returns lists where:
    tl.Owner.Id == userId (the user owns the list), or
    tl.Items.Any(i => i.ResponsiblePartyId == userId) (the user is assigned to at least one item).
    The TodoListController.Index() method uses this new query.
